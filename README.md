<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h3>

- 💼 &nbsp; I sell cars for a living.
- - ✍️ &nbsp; I have been writing front end code for a while now.
- - 🤔 &nbsp; I find product management quite fascinating. I like making low fidelity wireframes and coming up with quirky product ideas. I have done this for like 20 something products where I create wireframes, explain the problem statement and its value proposition, define clear objectives, come up with use cases and build a business canvas.
